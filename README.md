# EIU-MaxSAT

This repository contains the implementation of the EIU-MaxSAT algorithm for (Weighted) Partial MaxSAT, as proposed in our paper:

Improving Local Search for (Weighted) Partial MaxSAT via Using Effective Information

## Usage Guide

To install and compile EIU-MaxSAT on a Unix/Linux machine, execute the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/zhaojinzhong923/EIU-MaxSAT.git  
cd EIU-MaxSAT
make
```

After compilation, an executable file named EIU-MaxSATwill be available in the EIU-MaxSATdirectory.
To run the algorithm, use the following command: `./starexec_run-runsolver.sh instance_name`.
